This repository is a bit of a mess, because it was inherited without any communication and was a bit of a mess in the first place.

Some of these are not useful at all, such as water_level, or test_mac_address (just look at the MAC address when uploading the code to an ESP).

All boards were on ESP32s, and every folder for a puzzle has the model for the cover of the box it's in.
