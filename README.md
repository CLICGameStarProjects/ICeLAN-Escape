# ICeLAN Escape Games
This repository stores the code for all previous ICeLAN escape games.

## Project structure
Each year's escape game gets its own folder. There is also a common folder for things needed by several years.

The folder for a year contains all files used in that year, usually with a folder per puzzle.

> :information_source: **Note!** *The folder for 2023 is badly organized. Future years will be better organized*

The common folder contains 3 subfolders:
- `code` contains any executable code that is common to several years, such as the code for the main controller
- `libraries` contains any custom libraries, such as the puzzle library that interfaces with the main controller
- `resources` contains any other resources, such as 3D models for some boxes
