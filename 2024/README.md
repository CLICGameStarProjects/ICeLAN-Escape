This shall be the folder for 2024. There is currently nothing here.

My (the guy who did 2023) current (right before Jan 1st) main idea is to base everything on a deck of cards, where the goal is to obtain 4 aces (the cards would have NFC or some similar identifier).

Each suit would be its own set of puzzles.

*Hearts*: "intuition" puzzles, like finding something and using it in the right place
*Diamonds*: "hardest" puzzles (cus diamonds are really hard, incredibly clever as you can see), codebreaking and other methodical/math puzzles
*Clubs*: puzzles on a computer bc lazy
*Spades*: puzzles that require searching through the room, such as a jigsaw puzzle

Being very ambitious for a moment, every section could have 3 puzzles (jack, queen, king), for a total of 12.

More realistically, each section could have 1-2 puzzles, for a total of ~6 puzzles

# Puzzles

### Encrypted diary
A diary where every entry begins with the same message (the date, and "hello diary" or smth). The first few are unencrypted, and the last unencrypted entry ends with "I'm going to start encrypting my entries because blah blah blah".
The entry will also contain a quick description of the encryption scheme (just a substitution cipher with a random key). Every entry is encoded with a different key (?)

Future entries are encrypted, but one can decrypt them by figuring out the key from the repeating pattern.

Alternatively, a keybook can be found somewhere else (?). A scratchpad is provided, as well as a pencil.

## Clubs

All of this happens on a computer with the oldest screen we can be bothered to find. CRT is ideal but heavy and hard to find, any ugly screen works.
The computer is set up to be on TTY (I'm assuming linux because that's what's easiest for this. If we can't get a Poseidon computer with linux, we can live boot it onto a USB, hopefully).


## Spades

A jigsaw puzzle with a passcode drawn onto it, only revealed when enough pieces are found. Cost: ~20 CHF? idk how much a puzzle costs

# Plot

Idk some magician obsessed with card tricks or smth.
